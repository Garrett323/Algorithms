## Neat Collection of interesting algorithms with example implementations
### Sorting 
This contains implementations for:
- Merge Sort $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$
- Quick Sort $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$

### Counting Inversions
This contains an algorithm that counts inversion by piggy bagging on top of Merge Sort which results in a super-linear algorithm $\left(\mathcal{O}(n\log n)\right)$ with only a slighty higher constant than Merge Sort.

### Computational Geomerty
Algorithms to find the closest pair of points in a plane 
- Exhaustive Search $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$
- Recursive Split Search $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$
